instructions:

 
this is a custom tool to combine any number of MD output trajectories into an *.hdf5 database. 
the PSF code only accepts the hdf5 databases consistent witht the format in this code.

compress_data.py is the wrapper calling the class in Compressor.py

look at the code: it is pretty obvious what the fields in the *hdf5 database are. i used this 
to combine LAMMPS simulations outputs with format:

ID type x y z vx vy vz 

for either pos as function of time [for S(Q,w)] or vels as function of time for SED. 

can easily be adapted to any other software or output file format.
