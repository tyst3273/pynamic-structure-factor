the input options suppose that calculations are done with LAMMPS using an orthorhombic simulation box. 
the consequences of these assumptions are as follows: 

    (1) 'atom_types' below is a list of strings that are mapped to the 'atom types' in 
        the LAMMPS simulation. the atoms in 'atom_types' should be given in the same order 
        as used in the simulation. 

    (2) the orthorhombic simulation box is assumed since all that is written using the hdf5 
        dump method of lammps is the box lengths. so to calculate the box size dynamically, 
        we have to use these data which imposes an orhtorhombic simulation box. dervied from 
        this requirement is that the 'lattice_vectors' must also be orthorhombic. in most cases, 
        this isnt an overly restrictive requirement since you can just pick a conventional cell 
        that is orhto. make sure to convert the real Q-vectors you want to study to the new basis!
        NOTE: this restriction can be (fairly) easily reversed later on.
