the phonopy dir contains the POSCAR and FORCESETS file from a finite-difference 
harmonic phonon calculation using phonopy interfaced to LAMMPS. it used a 4x4x4
expansion of the *conventional* cell and the SiCGe.tersoff Tersoff potential
that is in the LAMMPS directory. using LAMMPS with phonopy is non-standard so i 
hacked it a bit. i chose not to include all of the files in the workflow since it 
was very convoluted.
