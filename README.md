# pynamic-structure-factor
python code to calculate inelastic neutron and x-ray scattering dynamic structure factors, 
S(Q,w), from molecular dynamics trajectories using parallelism over Q-points.

this is ready to use as is, but I haven't finished any documentation or examples on how to use it ...
I plan to do this *eventually* but don't have time allocated for it. 

actually, the input variables are documented in ./psf/defaults.py but these were mainly for my own 
benefit and may not be perfectly helpful for a new user to learn how to use the code. 

please contact me at:
    ty.sterling@colorado.edu
if you really want to use my code and I can try to help.

thanks,
