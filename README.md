# pynamic-structure-factor
python code to calculate inelastic neutron and x-ray scattering dynamic structure factors, 
S(Q,w), from molecular dynamics trajectories using parallelism over Q-points.

NOTE: this is ready to use as is, but I haven't finished any documentation or examples on how to use it ...
I plan to do this *eventually* but don't have time allocated for it. please contact me at ty.sterling@colorado.edu
if you really want to use my code and I can try to help. 

thanks,
Ty
