# pynamic-structure-factor

## Description
Python code to calculate inelastic neutron and x-ray scattering dynamic structure factors, S(**Q**,*w*), from molecular dynamics trajectories using parallelism over **Q**-points.

Look at the manual (doc/manual.pdf) and the examples for how to use the code.

## Updates (that aren't in the manual yet)
- Using parallelism over **Q**-points with multiprocessing may clash with OMP parallelism on the backend (`numpy`/`scipy` are built against `openBLAS` or `MKL` which may be threaded.) Neither my code nor the backend check if the other is parallized, so if you request all procs and the backend uses all threads, your computer will be very over utilized and performance will be poor. You can set the number of threads with the enviroment variable `OMP_NUM_THREADS` or you can set it at run-time by passing a flag `-n NUMBER_OF_THREADS` when you run `PSF.py`. e.g. `python PSF.py -i input.py -n 1`. Note, I havent noticed any gain with hybrid parallelism in my implementation, so I usually request 1 thread and let multiprocessing handle everything with `num_Qpoint_procs`. I will update the manual when I have time! 

## To-do:
Note, if you want any of these features or any others, contact me (contact info above). I am busy, so will only implement these when I am bored/I need them... I may be motivated to do it sooner by someone asking me nicely!
- Use symmetry to reduce the number of **Q**-points. This isn't necesarilly sensible for disorderd systems, but can be used to quilty create colorplots, volumetric plots, etc. Anyway, *mantid* symmetrizes the real experimental data this. Easiest way to implement on top of current code is to use *spglib* to find the symmetry operations, the map each **Q**-point in the full grid to the others. Only calculate one from each star(?). Alternatively, use *spglib* to generate an irreducible grid... note, though, this only covers the 1st BZ. I could probably just cut our 'chunks' of the 1st BZ and extend into higher BZ's, but I need to think carefully about this.
- Add *plugins* to read trajectories depending on the user specified format. Should take 'block inds' as arg and return types, positions, etc. 
- Look into shared memory with multiprocessing. Probably also better performance to let each process read it's block of data from the hdf5 file rather than one proc reading and broadcasting. This will probably use less memory and might be faster ... 
- Consider a low-memory algorithm to calculate x-ray atomic form factors; the form factors f(Q) depend on |**Q**|, so I pre-calculate them outside of looping over trajectory data. The fastest way is to calculate an array with shape [num_atoms, num_Qpts], but this array is huge for big simulations and big **Q**-point grids (easily runs out of ram). 

## Bugs
- it has been brought to my attention that the parallel part of my code only works on linux. the problem is with multiprocessing. i am looking for a solution to get it to run in parallel on windows and mac ... please bear with me ... or switch to linux! you can still run in serial (just set num_Qpoint_procs = 1) on windows and mac. UPDATE: I think 'multiprocess', which is a fork of multiprocessing, fixes this, but I
haven't investigated in detail.

*Thanks, Tyler*
