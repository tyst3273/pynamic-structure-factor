# pynamic-structure-factor

UH OH!!! it has been brought to my attention that my code only works on linux. i am looking for a solution to get it to run on windows and mac... please bear with me unless you are already using linux. or switch to linux!

python code to calculate inelastic neutron and x-ray scattering dynamic structure factors, 
S(Q,w), from molecular dynamics trajectories using parallelism over Q-points.

look at the manual (doc/manual.pdf) and the examples for how to use it.
